- Identify and implement control flow techniques in JavaScript including ‘for’ loops, ‘if’ and if/else’ statements, as well as  ‘while’ and ‘do/while’ loops.
- Explain what HTML element attributes are and how to use them.
- Understand the different parts of the CSS box model.
- Create and switch between git branches to better manage our project.

### Notes
- code review
    - work on noticing when your code is repetitive so you can make it DRY
    - DRY = don't repeat yourself
    - "It's only hypothetical until it's parenthetical." 
        - so call your functions with their parenthesis! alert()

- git
    - what's a remote repo?
    - `git pull` and `git push`

- HTML
    - lists
        - types
        - use cases
            - dictionaries
            - navigation menus
    - attributes
        - global attributes
            - class, id
        - element specific attributes
            - src, href, value, alt

- CSS
    - linking an external file
    - more selectors
    - Box Model

- JavaScript
    - switch statement
    - for loop
        - repeats a block of code for a known number of times
    - do while loop
        - repeat a block of code at least once, until a condition turns false
    - while loop
        - repeat a block of code until a condition turns false
    - running `eslint`
        - in your terminal, assuming you are in the directory of files you want to test, run `eslint .`
        - you can also specify which file: `eslint app.js` or folder: `eslint js`

- Lab Prep
    - `git branch`
        - create a new branch for today's lab named `guessing-game`
    - **moving forward:** we will not grade anything that 
        - doesn't pass our class linter and 
        - doesn't have descriptive commit messages
